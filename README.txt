###Important Notes	
This plugin supports our most powerful API features and is intended for users who have not yet integrated their WooCommerce stores with Size Guarantee.	
You can run this new integration at the same time as your current WooCommerce integration for Size Guarantee.
	

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma-separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma-separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk'sreadme.txt points to the correct stable tag.
    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that the trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.
